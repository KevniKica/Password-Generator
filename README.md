# Password Generator Starter Code

# Development
1. Created base variables and created a path to the generate button. Then I created a prompt, length and another variable section for my variables
2. Made it so the user needs to declare a length of their password they want between 8 and 100 characters otherwise it will ask again.
3. Added the rest of the declared variables, prompts, and added the for loop.
